<b>                            JOKER
</b>
<b>                          AN ORIGIN
</b>



                         Written by

                 Todd Phillips & Scott Silver




                                                  13 April 2018 

  This story takes place in its own universe. It has no
  connection to any of the DC films that have come before it.

  We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate
  and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and
  the stakes are personal.

  Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes
  place in the past.

  Let's call it 1981.

  It's a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record
  highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past
  six weeks. And the divide between the "haves" and the "have-
  nots" is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into
  delusions.



<b>                                                      OVER BLACK:
</b>
<b>    HEAR LAUGHTER.
</b>
    The sound of a man totally cracking up.

<b>                                                        FADE IN:
</b>

<b>1   INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING                          1
</b>
    CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so
    hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black
    hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded
    zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years
    of use, hangs loosely around his neck.

    WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his
    mouth. Almost forming a smile.

    He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),
    African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a
    cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high
    in front of her.

    She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit
    to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.

    Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.

    Beat.

<b>                        JOKER
</b>              --is it just me, or is it getting
              crazier out there?

    Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
    Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days.

<b>                         SOCIAL WORKER
</b>              It's certainly tense. People are
              upset, they're struggling. Looking
              for work. The garbage strike seems
              like it's been going on forever.
              These are tough times.
                  (then)
              How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
              enjoying it?

<b>                          JOKER
</b>              Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
              day, so   I really like that. I don't
              think I   could ever work in an
              office.   Behind a desk.
<b>                          (MORE)
</b><b>                                                         2.
</b>
<b>                     JOKER (CONT'D)
</b>              (beat)
          No offense.

She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's
running late for her next appointment.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Have you been keeping up with your
          journal?

<b>                       JOKER
</b>          Everyday.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Great. Did you bring it with you?

Beat.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>              (dodging the subject)
          I'm sorry. Did I bring what?

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>              (impatient; she doesn't
               have time for this)
          Arthur, last time I asked you to
          bring your journal with you. For
          these appointments. Do you have it?

<b>                       JOKER
</b>          Yes ma'am.

Beat.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Can I see it?

He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered
notebook. Slides it across to her--

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          I've been using it as a journal,
          but also a joke diary. Funny
          thoughts or, or observations-- Did
          I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
          stand-up comedy?

She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          No. You didn't.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          I think I did.
<b>                                                            3.
</b>

She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Oh yeah. Because of what your
          mother said,-- about your purpose.
          "To bring laughter and joy to the
          world," right?

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Right.

ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,
angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore
pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.

A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at
his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.
His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          I didn't realize you wanted to read
          it.

The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in
the pages that gives her pause.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>              (reading out loud)
          "I just hope my death makes more
          sense than my life."

She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out
there for a beat.

Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's
funny--

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Yeah. I mean, that's just--

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Does my reading it upset you?

He leans in.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          No. I just,-- some of it's
          personal. You know?

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          I understand. I just want to make
          sure you're keeping up with it.

She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.
<b>                                                         4.
</b>

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          What about your mom? How's she
          feeling?

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          She has good days. But mostly bad.
          It's been a big help having me
          there. She really needs me.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Seems like she's been sick a lot
          since you got home.

<b>                     JOKER
</b>              (nods)
          Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
          was in the hospital, after my last
          episode-- she was having trouble
          getting over there to visit.

She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next
appointment.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          All right. So, I'll see you again,
          two weeks from today?

He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.

She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Is there something else I can help
          you with, Arthur? My next
          appointment is waiting.

He just keeps sitting there.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Yeah, I was wondering if you could
          ask the doctor to increase the
          dosage on my medications? Nothing
          seems to make a difference.

<b>                     SOCIAL WORKER
</b>              (looking over his record)
          Do you know which ones you'd like
          increased?

Shakes his head, no.

<b>                    SOCIAL WORKER
</b>          Have you been sleeping?
<b>                                                              5.
</b>

<b>                        JOKER
</b>                  (lying)
              Some.

    She glances at his file again.

<b>                        SOCIAL WORKER
</b>              Arthur, you're on seven different
              medications. Surely they must be
              doing something.

    He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.

    Looks at her--

<b>                        JOKER
</b>              I just don't wanna feel so bad
              anymore.

<b>2   EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP - DAY         2
</b>
    GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking
    horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,
    giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.
    Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something
    bouncy and fast-paced.

    FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed
    as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.

    Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted
    on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in
    white, turned down at the corners.

    He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that
    reads, "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" A banner above the store reads,
    "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano
    on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the
    big sale going on in the store.

    Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the
    music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump
    into him by mistake.

    JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,
    walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up
    laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.
<b>                                                                6.
</b>

    Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while
    maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the
    sign.

    One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--

<b>                        KID #1
</b>              Suck my dick, clown.

    The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over
    to pick up the sign--

    Another kid kicks him in the ass--

<b>                        KID #2
</b>              Whoops.

    Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man
    playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--

    The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and
    takes off running across the street--

    The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--

    Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.

    He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in
    time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
    of hitting him.

    Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown
    barreling down the street has got to be a joke--

    The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing
    and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp
    right turn down a cross street--

    Joker almost overshoots the corner, slip-sliding in his big
    red shoes--

    He rights himself and heads down after them--

    Sees them running up ahead--

    WHAP! Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!

    He falls to the ground.

    One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker
    with the "EVERYTHING MUST GO!" sign, splintering it in two--

</b>

    The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the
    ground.

    Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign--

    THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker.
    It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.

    CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat
    running down his face, smearing his make-up. He doesn't even
    look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating.

    That stupid frown painted on his face.


<b>4   INT. CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) - HEADING DOWNTOWN - DUSK            4
</b>
    Joker, makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus, now
    walking with a slight limp, but keeping his head held high.

    His make-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a
    big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease-
    paint still smudged on the sides of his face.

    He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad-
    eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on
    her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,
    but even from behind you can tell she's angry.

    Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He
    doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small.
    He gets back into "character" smiling like a clown and covers
    his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game
    with her.

    The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles--

<b>                         WOMAN ON BUS

                    already annoyed)
              Can you please stop bothering my
              kid?

<b>                        JOKER

              Just stop.

    AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth
    trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a
    moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It
    actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.
<b>                                                                                   8.
</b>

    People on the bus are staring. The girl looks like she's
    going to cry again.

<b>                            WOMAN ON BUS
</b>                  You think that's funny?

    Joker shakes his head no, but he can't stop laughing. He
    reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to
    the woman.

    CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: "Forgive my laughter. I have a
    condition (more on back)"

    She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information
    in small writing--
    "It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that
    doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain
    neurological conditions."

    She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you
    could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card
    on the ground.

    Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.

    Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he
    pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover
    his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.

    He looks out at the city passing him by.

</b>
    The bus pulls away, sun almost gone.

    Joker heads slowly down the litter-covered streets. Garbage
    is piled along the sidewalks, the air thick with smog creates
    a haze over everything.

    The streets are crowded with the poor, the elderly and
    disenfranchised. Women with children in busted strollers.
    Homeless people sleeping on subway grates. Stray dogs. His is
    one of the few white faces.

    Joker makes his way into a run-down drug store, behind him
    two drunks fight on the corner, beating the shit out of each
    other. Joker, and nobody else for that matter, pays them any
    attention.

    No one here gives a shit.

    A shabby lobby in a building that was once probably pretty
    nice, but now it's a dump.

    Joker checks his mailbox. He's holding a small white
    (prescription) bag in his hand.

    The mailbox is empty.


<b>7   INT. ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                  7

    Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator, harsh fluorescent            
    lights, graffiti on the walls. As the door closes, he hears--

    He puts his foot out with some panache to stop the closing
    door-- He's a romantic at heart. Ding.

    And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20's), tired eyes, hands filled with
    grocery bags, steps onto the elevator with GIGI, her 5-year-
    old daughter.

<b>                         SOPHIE

              Of course it's you,-- everyone else
              in this building is just so fucking
              rude.

    Joker nods "thanks." Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't
    start to laugh.

    Floors dinging as the elevator rises.

    Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail
    behind her mom.

<b>                        SOPHIE

    He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her,
    holds up the white prescription bag.

    Joker smiles thanks, can't help but glance at GiGi licking
    the rail.

    Sophie finally notices. She wants to grab her but can't with
    her hands full. Tries to kick her away--

              This building is so awful, isn't
              it?

    Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly
    wants to continue this conversation with Sophie.

    The doors open. They all step off.

    sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg.

     Now Joker sees a GROUP OF MEN walking behind the glass that
     separates the reception area from the back offices. Amongst
     the group, he catches a glimpse of THOMAS WAYNE (60's), deep
     tan, hair dyed so black it's almost blue.

<b>                         JOKER

                    shouts)
               Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.

     He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving.
     Not noticing him.

<b>                         RECEPTIONIST
</b>               Sir. Please stop. Sir!!

     Joker keeps banging on the glass.

     The glass doors swing open and Joker is forcibly thrown onto
     the street. TWO LARGE SECURITY GUARDS stand over him.

     He is still holding the letter.

     He makes as if he's going to leave peacefully, then at the
     last minute, TAKES ANOTHER RUN AT THE DOOR--

     The two guards stiff arm him.

     The cramped locker room of a small talent booking agency.
     This is where Joker works. They "rent out" talent for parties
     and events. Clowns, magicians, male strippers.

     Joker takes off his shirt, grimaces in pain as he moves. His
     body's bruised from the beating he took chasing after his
     sign.

<b>                           RANDALL (OS)

     He turns. RANDALL (mid 50's), a big bear of a know-it-all,
     standing there. He's a party clown as well. He's half-dressed
     in his clown suit.

Randall opens his locker--

<b>                    RANDALL
</b>          It's crazy out there. And it's only
          getting worse.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          It means like "feeling for other

Randall comes over, hands Joker a brown paper bag-- Joker
looks inside. It's a GUN, a .38 snub-nose revolver.            

Joker looks up at him, confused--

<b>                    RANDALL

          It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
          done if you ever need to use it.
          Usually pulling it out is enough.

     Joker nods. Puts the brown paper bag in his locker. Slowly         
     starts to get dressed-- his eyes darting toward the bag as he      
     does.

     Another clown, GARY (30's), a dwarf, pops his head into the

     His boss, HOYT VAUGHN (60's) sits behind a metal desk. The
     office is a complete mess, newspapers and files litter the
     desk. A giant ashtray filled with cigarette butts. A calendar
     of booking hangs on the wall. A scribbled, jumbled mess.

<b>                         JOKER

Joker goes to sit down--

</b>          Don't sit. This will be quick.

Joker stops in his tracks.

          It's probably that stupid laugh. It
          gets me every time. Kills me.

Unsure how to respond, Joker just nods.

<b>                    HOYT
</b>          But I got another complaint. And
          it's starting to piss me off.

Joker takes a deep breath, maybe picks at his eyebrow.

          He's going out of business for

BANG! Out of nowhere, Joker slams his head into the wall.
Head-butting it hard.

     REVEAL, Joker is watching his own building on the far side of
     a parked truck. Red hood pulled up, covering his head. He
     waits. Watches.

     counting her drawer.

     Takes another deep breath. Then--

She laughs.

He stands there awkwardly for a moment looking around to see

     Joker walks back to the wall by the forms.

     He fumbles around for a minute, clearly not there to open an

     jumble of lit-up signs, most glowing yellow or red. Joker          
     walks out alone, carrying his notebook. He sees a FLYER taped

     Joker is working on his "Mr. Jingles" clown look, using the
     small mirror in his locker. Behind him a couple of other
     clowns are eating their lunch at a small table, not paying
     Joker any attention.

     Joker pauses half-finished, and stares at himself for a beat.
     He starts to examine the two small scars on the corners of
     his mouth, we really notice how they form a smile. Joker
     hooks the corners of his mouth down with his index fingers,
     turning his smile into a frown--

     He lets go and his smile returns.

     Does it again, up and down, up and down, his face a living
     comedy/tragedy mask.

     And then he pulls his fingers wider, stretching his smile
     into a grotesque parody, pulling his mouth so wide tears come
     to his eyes--

     Joker takes an exaggerated and ridiculous bow--

     pants and slides across the floor.

     Everyone stops. Looks at the gun on the floor.

attention. The other two share a look. Joker watches from his

The other two guys crack up at this apparent blow-off. The

starts softly flinging fries at the young woman.

One of the french fries lands in her hair. She looks down
toward Joker, looking to see if he's going to do something or
say something--

Joker just sits there nervous. Not sure what to do, or even
if he wants to do anything at all.

AND HE JUST BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. He covers his mouth with his
hand as they continue to harass the woman.

They all look over-- What the fuck is this clown laughing at?

Joker sees them staring. Looks down at the ground, hand still
covering his mouth, face turning red. Subway swaying, lights
flickering on and off.

singing "Send in the Clowns" as he approaches--

          Send in the clowns.                                    

The others crack up and follow after him. The guy plops down
next to Joker, puts his arm around his shoulder as he sings--

<b>                    JOKER
</b>              (shakes his head, stifling
               the laughter)

          Don't you approve?
          One who keeps tearing around,
          One who can't move.

Joker starts to get up-- The lead guy pulls him back down.

<b>                    WALL STREET #1
</b>          Where are the clowns?
          There ought to be clowns.

As he finishes the song, Joker's laughing fit is coming to an
end. One of the other guys sits down on the other side of        
him. He's now sandwiched in between them--

Joker reaches into his bag to get one of his "Forgive my
laughter" cards, the third guy sees him reaching and tries to
grab the bag from him---

Joker pulls on it--

The guy rips the bag from his hand--

Joker gets up from between them to go grab his bag back. The
two guys are cracking up.

Joker reaches out to grab the bag--

And the guy tosses it over his head to one of his friends.
Keeping it away from Joker.

Three guys in suits tossing a bag around, playing 'monkey in    
the middle' with a clown. THE LIGHTS ON THE TRAIN SEEM TO       
GLOW BRIGHTER AND WE HEAR the drum roll opening to BOBBY        
SHORT singing "Send in the Clowns" Live at the Caf Carlyle.    

Joker keeps trying to catch his bag until suddenly--

WHAP! Out of nowhere one of the guys punches him hard in the
face.

Joker goes down as if in slow motion. Blood coming from his
nose. He tries to get up, but his feet slip from under him
and he falls back down--

<b>                    WALL STREET #1
</b>          Stay down you freak.

And the third Wall Street guy starts kicking him--

The others join in. Surrounding Joker on the ground, kicking    
him deliberately, sadistically, and the music swells--          

<b>BLAM!
</b>
SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS GO BACK DIM, and one of the guys stops
kicking and falls back dead. Blood splattering on the subway
wall behind him--

And we HEAR Bobby Short sing out, picking up from where the     
Wall Street Guy left off--

     everywhere...

     The subway doors wheeze open and Joker steps halfway off the
     train, waiting to see if the third Wall Street guy gets off
     in the car ahead of him. Joker sees him run off--

     pulls the gun out of his waist, looking around for someplace       
     to throw it out. Under the sink he sees a rusted, metal grate      
     hanging off the wall covering some pipes.                          

     Before he bends down, Joker catches his reflection in the

     He hears footsteps. Quickly pulls the folded-up flyer out of

          and they were the best of the best.

A small smirk registers on Joker's face when photos of the
THREE WALL STREET GUYS come up on the screen.

          personally, like all Wayne

Joker's mom perks up at that--

               that cold-blooded? Someone who
               hides behind a mask. Someone who's
               envious of those more fortunate
               than themselves, yet too scared to
               show their own face.
                   (to camera)
               And until that jealousy ends, those
               of us who've made a good life for
               ourselves will always look at those
               who haven't as nothing but clowns.

AND JOKER STARTS LAUGHING. He puts a hand over his mouth
trying to cover it, but he can't stop cracking up--

It's unsettling and disturbing for Sophie. People eating,         
waiters in red vests, busboys, all look over and stare at         
him. A few laugh. Joker turns away embarrassed, he looks out      
the plate-glass window, face turning red from laughing so
hard--

AS HE LOOKS OUT, HE SEES A GROUP OF ROWDY KIDS walking down
the street. One of them glances back before he turns the
corner-- HE'S WEARING A CLOWN MASK THAT LOOKS JUST JOKER'S
CLOWN FACE. And then he's gone. The group disappears around
the corner--

Joker can't believe his eyes, still laughing-- He turns to
Sophie who didn't see them. Just sits there awkwardly waiting
for it to stop.

Finally, it subsides--

     doggie bag in his hand, sees the flickering blue light of the      
     TV on in the living room, hears the end of "LIVE WITH MURRAY

     high on the door.

          "That's life."

He hears Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra playing the show's
closing song-- the instrumental version of Frank Sinatra's
"That's Life".

As the music continues, Joker puts his face up against his
mom's nose, to see if she's breathing or if she's dead.

He feels her breath against his cheek.

Now he picks his mother up in his arms and carries her into
her bedroom to the music, almost as if he's dancing with her
as he leaves the room...

We stay behind.

"That's Life" still playing from TV.

He comes back into the living room and turns off the TV.
Takes off his jacket and throws it on the couch. Notices
something sticking out of his jacket pocket. He pulls it out.

It's the envelope he was supposed to deliver to Thomas Wayne.

He stares at it for a beat. And then--

Quietly rips it open, starts to read the letter:

CLOSE ON WORDS, "Dearest Thomas, I don't know where else to
turn..."

"Need your help..."

"You have a son. We have a son. His name is Arthur."

Stops reading, stays on--

"You have a son."

     sleep. He has clearly been up all night. Still wearing the

     He's holding her letter in his hand as the sun is just
     starting to rise outside the windows, light just beginning to
     crack the gloom.

     THE ORANGE CAT SITS AT HIS FEET staring up at him, won't take
     her eyes off of him.

     Joker impatiently sits there for another moment waiting for
     his mother to wake up, then suddenly--

     SHRIEKS OUT AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS like a teapot, kicking
     his back on the chair like an excited toddler--

     His mother wakes with a start, looking around half asleep and

     Looming behind him like the skeletons of monsters, a

     Joker walking along an intimidating wrought iron fence,            
     surrounding the estate like prison bars, the brown paper           
     shopping bag stuffed under his arm. The big house set up a         
     small hill, evergreens dot the lush grounds. As he walks
     around looking for the front entrance, Joker catches a
     glimpse of an innocent looking EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY tracking         
     him from behind the trees, hiding as he follows.

     Joker stops.

     He sees the boy stop behind a tree.

     Joker continues walking until he gets to the front gate. He
     digs into his bag and pulls out the magic wand--

     He holds it up for the boy to see.

     The boy steps out from behind a tree to get a closer look.

     Joker puts the brown bag down on the ground, looks over the        
     wand, pretending like he's trying to figure out what it does.
     He waves the wand over the front gate lock to "try and see"
     if it will open-- It doesn't.

The little boy walks down toward the fence, face like an          
angel.                                                            

Joker waits until he gets closer and then reaches his hand        
through the fence and hands the kid his magic wand so he can      
try and figure out what it does--

The boy takes the wand and it goes limp in his hand before he     
can wave it-- He laughs, surprised. He hands it back to
Joker.

The boys sees Joker's face up close, staring at his scarred       
smile--

Joker straightens the wand back out, and reaches in through       
the fence again so the kid can give it another try.               

AND AGAIN THE MAGIC WAND DROOPS IN THE BOY'S HAND. He laughs      
and gives it back to Joker--                                      

Joker examines the wand as if its "broken", stiffens it one       
last time, crouches down lower, and...                            

Ta-da! A bouquet of flowers bursts out the end of the wand--

Joker smiles and hands him the wand bouquet of flowers--          

The little boy takes the flowers. Keeps staring at Joker, at      
the scars around his mouth.                                       

Now, he reaches his hand out through the fence and touches        
Joker's face, tracing his finger around the edges of Joker's      
mouth, over his scarred smile--                                   

Joker closes his eyes -- embarrassed -- but it feels good to      
him, nobody ever touches him besides his mother.

He starts to smile, when a man's voice shatters the moment--

his breath.

And Joker cracks up again, his laughter coming back harder--
He covers his mouth with his hand, shaking his head no, his
face now turning red.

Joker catches his breath as the intensity of his laughter
starts to wane, petering out.

</b>          Not for having a gun. That was prop
          gun. Part of my act.

Joker's laughter finally stops for good.

     Murray Franklin cracks up at his own joke. Studio audience
     laughs.

     JOKER LAUGHS, LYING IN BED NEXT TO HIS UNCONSCIOUS MOTHER in
     the large overcrowded treatment room.

     Blue curtain dividers separate the bays. He's watching the
     show on a TV bolted high on the wall. He glances over at his
     mother, laughing over the sounds of her labored breath, the
     pain and suffering of those around him.

     Joker glances back into the auditorium--

     Sees a lobby broom and upright dustpan tucked in the back
     corner--


<b>70   INT. HALLWAY, MEN'S ROOM - WAYNE HALL - SECONDS LATER       70
</b>
     Joker's sweeping up the hallway with his head down, hear the
     orchestra playing the melancholy "Smile" from the film's
     score. He sweeps along to the music like Emmett Kelly's
     famous hobo clown... Sweeping around the two security guards'
     feet... Annoyed, they move a bit away from the bathroom
     door... And don't give Joker a second look as he heads
     inside...


<b>71   INT. MEN'S ROOM, WAYNE HALL - CONTINUOUS                    71
</b>
     Joker sweeps his way into the cavernous, black & white tiled
     bathroom, ornate gold fixtures. It's empty save for Thomas
     Wayne peeing at the far end of a long line of urinals.

     Joker takes a deep breath, and walks down the line of urinals
     right up next to Thomas Wayne--

     He stands there for a beat while Thomas urinates, lobby broom
     and upright dustpan in hand--

<b>                         THOMAS WAYNE

          You need to get in here or
          something?

Thomas Wayne finishes and zips his fly back up. Joker is not
sure what to say to him, just says--

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Dad. It's me.

Beat.

But Thomas Wayne doesn't hear him, he was flushing the
urinal. He walks toward the sink.

<b>                       THOMAS WAYNE
</b>          Excuse me?

Joker follows after him.

<b>                     JOKER

          I know you didn't know about me,
          and I don't want anything from you.
          Well... maybe a hug.

And Joker smiles, it's all very emotional for him. Thomas
looks over at him like he's fucking crazy.

<b>                    THOMAS WAYNE
</b>          Jesus? You're the guy who came by
          my house yesterday.

Joker nods, relieved he finally broke through.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
          wouldn't let me see you. So I came
          here. I have so many questions.

Thomas Wayne just laughs to himself and turns on the gold
faucets at one of the sinks.

<b>                    THOMAS WAYNE

<b>                    JOKER

Thomas Wayne just keeps washing his hands, doesn't even look
over at Joker.

<b>                    THOMAS WAYNE

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          No. What? I wasn't adopted.

Thomas starts drying his hands.

<b>                    THOMAS WAYNE
</b>          She never told you? Your mother
          adopted you before she even started
          working for us. She was arrested
          when you were four years old and
          committed to Arkham State Hospital.
          She's batshit crazy.

Joker starts to smile, feels a laugh coming on.

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          No. No, I don't believe that.

Thomas finishes drying his hands. Turns to Joker, his tone
way more serious now.

<b>                    THOMAS WAYNE
</b>          I don't really give a shit   what you

          again, if I ever even hear   about

AND JOKER CRACKS UP LAUGHING, interrupting his threat.
Laughing right in his face--

<b>                    THOMAS WAYNE
</b>          Are you laughing at me?

Joker's laughing so hard he can't answer.

THOMAS SHOVES JOKER HARD UP AGAINST THE TILED WALL, gripping
his neck with one hand. Joker just cracks up louder, he drops
the dustpan and broom--

<b>                    THOMAS WAYNE
</b>              (shouting)
          You think this is funny?

Thomas Wayne's security guards bang open the door, rushing
into the bathroom when they hear the shouting--

     the wall.

               Is this a fucking joke to you?

     AND THOMAS WAYNE PUNCHES JOKER STRAIGHT IN THE FACE with his
     free hand, blood spraying from his nose--


<b>72   EXT. WAYNE HALL, FRONT ENTRANCE - PLAZA - NIGHT              72
</b>
     The two security guards roughly throw Joker out of the hall,
     right in front of the drenched crowd of screaming protesters,
     TV cameras and photographers now on hand, bulbs flashing--

     Joker knowing how to take a fall, plays it up in front of
     this audience for all it's worth, tumbling end-over-end out
     onto the plaza in the rain--

     He rolls to his feet with a bit of panache and brushes
     himself off like it was nothing.

     The protesters go crazy, cheering and applauding his act--

     And Joker takes a deep dramatic bow. Wet hair. Bloody nose.

     He turns and sees the security guards coming back out--

     Joker takes off running through the plaza in the downpour,
     running out of the Center for Performing Arts. Turns down a
     side street almost slipping--

     And keeps running even though nobody's chasing after him.

     We HEAR the familiar beats of THE SUGARHILL GANG'S "Apache"
     as Joker just keeps running and running.


<b>73   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - NIGHT                     73

     Joker knocking on Sophie's apartment door, "Apache" blaring
     inside. He's soaking wet, clothes clinging to his body.

     There's no answer.

     He knocks again. Hard to hear anything over the loud music.

     Now he tries the door. It's unlocked.

     WALKS INTO THE DARK LIVING ROOM, catches a glimpse of Sophie,
     naked riding on top of SOME GUY on the couch--

     The guy sees Joker standing in the shadows and jumps. Sophie
     turns and sees Joker as well. She screams--


<b>75   INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     75

     Joker rushing for his mother's apartment.

     Behind him, the guy comes out half naked into the hallway,
     zipping up his pants, screaming at Joker--

     Joker doesn't look back, doesn't hear the guy yelling at him--

     Quickly opens the door to his mother's apartment and hurries
     inside.

     A GRAY, BEHEMOTH STATE HOSPITAL looming over the city block.
     Metal screens cover steel-framed windows. Joker crosses the
     street toward the building, eyes weary, he hasn't slept in
     days.

     HE SEES TWO GOTHAM CITY COPS AND A PARAMEDIC rolling a gurney
     into the entrance... a naked, sunburned man screaming his
     head off is handcuffed to the stretcher underneath a white
     sheet. Joker follows them inside.

A constant din of people moving about, talking and shouting.
Patients handcuffed to the armrests of their wheelchairs,
lying on stretchers, heads covered with pillowcase turbans or
forearms to block out the harsh fluorescent lights.

His gaze is interrupted by a CLERK (40's), ID clipped to his
shirt, who's lugging an old heavy file storage box.

He drops the box down on his messy desk with a thud.

<b>                    CLERK
</b>          Sorry for the wait. All our records
          that are 10 years or older are
          stored in the basement. You're

Joker nods thanks.

</b>          Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
          still gonna need a release from

The clerk opens the file box. Starts digging though it. Joker
stares out the plexiglass window that faces the hallway--

<b>                    JOKER
</b>          Can I ask you a question? How does

          pose a danger to themselves or

Beat.

The clerk is half listening as he scans the paper work.

Joker looks up at the guy, thinking he's made a connection.

For the first time, the clerk looks at him--

          really know what to tell you, but
          maybe you should see someone-- they

Moves the box to the floor and sits down at his desk.

further ahead. Joker just looks at the guy, waiting to see       
what he's gonna say.

          Besides, it's pretty bad.

CLOSE ON JOKER, he shakes his head and smiles to himself.

Joker just sits there, thinking it all over for a moment.

Then snatches the file off the clerk's desk--

The clerk grabs it as well.

They play tug-of-war with the file, it's awkward and goes on
way too long. Finally, Joker shoves the guy hard and pulls
the file away--

     ANGLE ON JOKER, catching his breath. He opens the file,

Joker pulls them out and jams them into Randall's eye before
he can react. The sound is sickening. Gary's screaming in the
background--

Randall blindly fights back, screaming in pain, flailing his
arms, his own blood blinding him--

Joker grabs Randall by the head -- all of his pent up rage
and frustration pouring out of him -- AND SLAMS HIS HEAD
<b>AGAINST THE WALL.

AGAIN. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.

Joker lets go of Randall's head, and Randall drops to the
ground. Joker leans back against the wall, out of breath,
kind of slides down the wall to the floor--

Sees Gary huddled in the corner, trembling with fear--

     to the chain-lock. He can't reach it.

     Joker just shakes his head to himself and gets up to unlock
     the door.

     He walks past Gary who's still trembling almost too afraid to
     look up at him. Joker leans over him and undoes the chain,
     opens the door. Gary bolts, running down the hallway as fast

     The car directly behind the cab skids to a stop just before
     running over Joker's face. Swerving into the other lane and

      Train heading downtown. The train's packed with protesters
      heading to the rally at City Hall. Many carrying signs...
      most of them in "Joker" masks... a few painted up to look
      like the "Joker" mask. Joker fits in with all of them.             

      He looks through the crowd of clowns and sees the two cops
      getting to the top of the stairs, looking up and down the
      platform for him. Pulling out their badges on chains from
      around their necks. Identifying themselves as cops.

      Joker's willing the doors to close. But they don't.

Joker hears some on the train shouting back in anger at the

The two cops push through the car, scanning all the "clown"       
faces... So many look like Joker. They just shove protesters      
out of the way, shouting at them all the while. A few more        
voices rising up in protest--                                     

Joker feels Burke and Garrity behind him getting closer. In       
the flickering light sees a DRUNK GUY (20's) wearing a            
'Joker' mask and pulls it right off his face--                    

The drunk guy turns ready to fight.                               

He throws a punch at Joker, and Joker steps out of the way--      

The guy pummels someone else--                                    

A FIGHT BREAKS OUT, spilling down the car.

      nervously smiles to them and keeps walking. Both men turn and
      check out her ass. Murray winks at Gene.

      room, watching the local news on a TV that's mounted up on
      the wall, live shots from the subway station where Burke shot      
      the protestor, footage of the City Hall rally, clashes with

      paint smeared more evenly over his face, green dyed hair
      slicked back in place. Red lips redone.

      Murray and his producer Gene open the dressing room door
      without knocking--

      Joker gets up off the couch and goes to shake Murray's hand.

Joker looks like he's about to bust out laughing. All of that    
news is playing out on the TV above their heads. He takes a      
deep breath. Swallows the laugh.                                 

Beat.

Murray thinks about it for a beat.

Gene rubs his temples, he doesn't like this, but Murray is
the boss.

Joker nods good. Smiles back at Murray.

Murray and Gene turn to go, exchanging smirks with each other
as they walk out, making light of Joker who we see behind
them still standing there.

      APPLAUSE SIGN LIGHTS UP. Everyone claps. Joker keeps watching      
      Murray through the slim gap at the end of the curtain. Hears
      the floor director shout, "And we're out. Back in three."

BEHIND THE BLUE CURTAIN, Joker gathers himself, ready for his
moment. Doesn't hear his introduction or see a STAGEHAND pull
open the curtain for him to go out--

ON SET, THE CURTAIN'S OPEN, Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra
are playing Joker on. He doesn't come out. Murray looks over
to the empty space in the curtain.

The audience laughs.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN, Joker sees the stagehand motioning for
him to go out on stage. Joker starts out, pausing when he
takes a step into the bright lights. The stagehand doesn't
see him stop, and drops the curtain back on Joker before the
audience can really see his face--

Tangling Joker up in the curtain.

The audience keeps laughing thinking it's part of his act.
The band keeps playing him on. Joker untangles himself from
the curtain and the audience gets a good look at him.

Some continue laughing. A few boo. Most don't know what to
make of him.

Joker walks across the stage, forgetting to wave like he
practiced. He trips over the riser surrounding the set when
he goes to shake Murray's hand. Almost falls on him.

Murray tries not to crack up. The audience laughs. Thinks
it's part of Joker's act.

Joker reaches out to hug Dr. Sally as she goes in for a
handshake. Another awkward moment. More laughs.

Joker finally sits down next to Murray. Crosses and uncrosses
his legs. Can't get comfortable.

answer Murray.

Nervous laughter from the audience.

Pulls out his worn notebook, catching his breath. Looks
through it to find a new joke.

      the groovy organ opening to FRANK SINATRA's anthem "That's        
      Life"...                                                          

      Beat.                                                             


<b>128   INT. HALLWAY, ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING              128    
</b>
      From behind, see Joker shuffling down the hallway past all        
      the other mental patients, an orderly by his side. Sinatra        
      starts singing.                                                   

      And Joker does a slide step to the music like he can hear it      
      too... into a skip... and another slide step into a spin...       
      Dancing down the hallway into the sunset...
